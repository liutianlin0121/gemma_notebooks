    "# GSM8K evaluation using Gemma\n",
    "\n",
    "The [GSM8K dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14168.pdf) presents a good evaluation challenge for small models for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conceptual Simplicity:** While the problems in GSM8K require multi-step reasoning, they primarily involve elementary mathematical concepts and basic arithmetic operations. This makes the dataset accessible to smaller models that may not have the capacity to handle complex mathematical reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linguistic Diversity:** GSM8K emphasizes linguistic diversity, ensuring that problems are not simply variations of the same template. This forces models to generalize their understanding of language and mathematical concepts, rather than relying on superficial pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Moderate Difficulty:** The problems in GSM8K are challenging enough to test the limits of small models without being completely intractable. This allows for meaningful evaluation and comparison of different models and methods within a reasonable difficulty range.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Natural Language Solutions:** GSM8K provides solutions in natural language, encouraging models to develop verbal analytical skills and produce human-interpretable reasoning steps. This is particularly relevant for smaller models that may struggle with purely symbolic or equation-based solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on grade-school math concepts and emphasizing linguistic diversity, GSM8K provides a valuable benchmark for evaluating the informal reasoning abilities of smaller language models and identifying areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2B Gemma checkpoint achieves a score of 19%, which is a higher result than obtained using [much larger competing checkpoints](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/arithmetic-reasoning-on-gsm8k)."

    "Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\n",
